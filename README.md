## The Game

This is my first ever game. I have no prior experience in coding. It's all very new to me but I'm learning as I go. Occasionally I'll update the source code here, but most development is done offline. You can play the latest uploaded build [here (use Firefox for best experience)](https://charlesbroque.github.io/uranium-fever/) but keep in mind that most features will still be missing or outright not work for some time as I figure out how to spaghetti them together.

Whether you're here from school or simply interested in looking at this code, thank you for visiting.
